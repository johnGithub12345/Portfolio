# Portfolio
Portfolio of some of my past work done in my free time.

'webdev' files are for a JavaScript webapp using Konva. The small shape can be dragged around and it snaps to the big shape.

'bullet_heck' files are for Python 3.10.9 using Pygame. WASD to move, space to parry incoming boss projectiles (triangles).
